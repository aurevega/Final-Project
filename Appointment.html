                <p>
                We make every effort to reserve enough time for your appointment.
                Please arrive 10 minutes prior to your appointment as to not 
                inconvenience our other clients. It may be necessary to deduct time 
                from a treatment from late arrivals.
                </p>
                <h3>Cancellations</h3>
                <p>
                Cancellations must be received at least 24 hours prior to an appointment 
                time. If an appointment is rescheduled or cancelled on the day of service, 
                and the appointment was reserved for three hours or more, you will be 
                charged 50% of what the total cost would have been.
                </p>
